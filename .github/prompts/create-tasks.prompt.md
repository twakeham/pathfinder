# Rule: Generating a Task List from a PRD

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD). The task list should guide a developer through implementation.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/docs/${input:feature}/`
- **Filename:** `${input:feature}-tasks.md` 
- **Example:** `/docs/main-ui-scaffolding/main-ui-scaffolding-tasks.md`

## Process

1.  **Receive PRD Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific PRD file
2.  **Analyze PRD:** The AI reads and analyzes the functional requirements, user stories, and other sections of the specified PRD.
3.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Based on the PRD analysis, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about 5. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level tasks based on the PRD. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
4.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
5.  **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task and cover the implementation details implied by the PRD.  Every parent task should have a final child action to generate test cases for all functionality developed in the parent case.
6.  **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the tasks and PRD, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Files` section, including corresponding test files if applicable.
7.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
8.  **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/docs/${input:feature}/` directory with the filename `${input:feature}-tasks.md`.
9.  **Log Task List Creation**: Add the creation of the task list to the PRD log for this feature.

## Output Format

The generated task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Files

- `src/path/to/potential/file1.py` - Brief description of why this file is relevant (e.g., Contains the main component for this feature).
- `tests/path/to/file1.test.py` - Unit tests for `file1.ts`.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely structural or configuration)
```

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the task list is a **junior developer** who will implement the feature.
